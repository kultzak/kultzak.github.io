Beavers...

Beavers have an inate inquietude when listeenning water pouring sound since they identify flaws in its dams by the sound of water. The better the dam the quieter. Its a fact that this behavior gives to beavers a lot of landscaping power which they use as protection against predators.

It is interesting to think about the evolutionary process that has directed the behavior of beavers and how this has passed from one generation to the next until we arrive at the current behavior.

What kind of thought structure causes them to take action to limit the leak? Is it something akin to indignation, a sense of duty, or some form of basic instinct that bears little resemblance to human feelings?

Analogous to thinking about beaver behavior, we can imagine how our species got to the top of the food chain, what kinds of tools and strategies were developed. We are also capable of building dams, perhaps for different reasons.

Below we have a link that presents human behavior. Falling off the top of a cliff(and perhaps the food chain itself) chasing a wheel of cheese.
